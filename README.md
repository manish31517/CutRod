# Cut-rod 

#Synopsis
Explore dynamic programming using the example of cutting a rod of length n

This program was created in response to:
book: Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition
Author: Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein 
Section 15.1, page 360

as a homework assignment for Dr. Gerry Howser, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Kalamazoo College.

The purpose of the program is to find a solution to the rod cutting problem using the algorithm PRINT-CUT-ROD-SOLUTION(p, n) and EXTENDED-BOTTOM-UPCOT-ROD(p, n).


ROD CUTTING PROBLEM: 

Given a rod of length n inches and a
table of prices pi for i D 1;2; : : : ;n, determine the maximum revenue rn obtainable
by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. Note that if the price pn for a rod
of length n is large enough, an optimal solution may require no cutting at all.
